Release 0.3 - 2010/05/23
  NEW FEATURES
    Added UDP Support. And the API was slightly changed from 0.2.
    Client and Server class became abstract class. TCPClient/TCPServer,
    UDPClient/UDPServer classes are the subclasses.

  BUG FIXES
    Calling the function with one null argument caused the error.

    Updated msgpack to version 0.3. This avoids the bug around zero-length
    array and the map.
